Tiny lib that dumps in-memory image of the current process to a file.  

> Just a PoC, untested and dirty, so feel free not to use it in production.  

### Usage

1. Compile the library, put `libselfieo.dylib` into your current directory;  
2. Run your target using this command:  

  ```bash
$ DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=libselfieo.dylib /Applications/mytarget.app/Contents/MacOS/mytarget
  ```
